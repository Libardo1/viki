Deep Learning for Speaker and Interruption Recognition in Company Meetings

## About
viki is a web app and deep learning system that listens to company meetings and can detect who is speaking when, and when one person interrupts another person.
viki aggregates these speaker and interruption statistics and allows a company to see how their employees are communicating with each other.
viki allows companies to pinpoint problems in their employee's communication habits such as: employees dominating meetings, 'manterruptions', etc.

## Note
This project was made for HACKMIT 2015.
It is a bare-bones prototyle built in ~20 hours so please excuse any bad code, organization, and incomplete features.
